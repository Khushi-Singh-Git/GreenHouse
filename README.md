# :seedling: GreenHouse Climate Controller System For Agri Research Applications

* A greenhouse is a framed or inflated structure covered with a transparent or translucent material in which fruits or vegetables or flower crops can be grown under the Controlled Climatic Conditions or at least partially controlled environment.

* Its mostly used in Agricultural Research to Study impact of Environmental Parameters on Crop Yield and its Nutritional Contents.

* Environmental Parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Ambient Light and Soil Moisture are kept under control as per crop need, using Sensors and Devices like AC, Dehumidifiers, Light, Foggers, and Water Pumps.

# :herb: Working
* I am collecting Environmental Parameters like Temperature, Humidity , Ambient Light and Soil Moisture using appropriate Sensors in real time.

* Based on Pre-Defined Values (as per crop research need) of these Parameters ,I am switching on/off devices like Cooling System, Dehumidifier , Water Pump etc.

* Sensor Data is being uploaded to Cloud.

* To Demonstrate these Capabilities , I controlled functioning of DC Pump , DC Motor, DC Fans and Light using suitable Relay Control.

* I used Arduino Mega with WiFi Development Board, Arduino IDE, Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Light Sensor , Soil Moisture Sensor , LCD Display , ESP8266 WiFi Board and 4 channel DC Relays.
