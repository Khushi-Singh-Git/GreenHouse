# :seedling: GreenHouse Climate Controller System For Agri Research Applications

* A greenhouse is a framed or inflated structure covered with a transparent or translucent material in which fruits or vegetables or flower crops can be grown under the Controlled Climatic Conditions or at least partially controlled environment.

* Its mostly used in Agricultural Research to Study impact of Environmental Parameters on Crop Yield and its Nutritional Contents.
